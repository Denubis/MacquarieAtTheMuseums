<h2 id="keynote-children-in-pompeii----the-invisible-majority">Keynote: Children in Pompeii – the invisible majority?</h2>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>A gap in the study of Pompeii is the presence of children in significant numbers within the city. My keynote lecture will seek to consider how this can be remedied and also to consider whether children could participate in the religious life of the city.  How do we place children into the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum?  My paper will draw on recent research on childhood to seek to incorporate the relationship between the agency of the child and the urban environment. I will seek to establish a framework for the study of the child in the city that will draw on recent developments within urban studies more generally. This analysis will feature a re-conceptualization of my own work on neighbourhoods of Pompeii to incorporate the world of the child. In addition, I will attempt to move forward to consider the extent to which Pompeii was a child-centered city.</p>

<h2 id="the-book-of-the-acts-of-the-apostles-as-a-source-for-the-history-of-earliest-christianity">The Book of the Acts of the Apostles as a Source for the History of Earliest Christianity</h2>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>The earliest known Christian documents are the letters of St. Paul. Though they tell us occasional points of detail about Jesus, and contain occasional first-hand material about Paul’s own past travels, current situation and future plans, they do not give us sufficient information to really begin writing a narrative history of even a small part of the early Christian movement. To tell the story of Jesus, and the story of the development of the movement which he founded, we are reliant on later, narrative sources. For Jesus himself we have primarily the four canonical Gospels. For the earliest Christian movement we have only the Acts of the Apostles, and a few scattered traditions in later first-century and early second-century Christian and secular writers.</p>

<p>The Acts of the Apostles is, then, a crucial source of information. Yet it is brief, highly selective, and its sources of information are largely unknowable. The lecture will discuss the approach an historian should take when attempting to write a history of earliest Christianity, given these factors.</p>

<h2 id="the-early-israelite-monarchy-in-text-and-archaeology">The Early Israelite Monarchy in Text and Archaeology</h2>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>Reconstructing the early Israelite monarchy is fraught with difficulty. Textual sources such as 1 and 2 Samuel are complex literary productions that have undergone later editing and/or record partial historical details relevant for the theological narrative of the Bible. Often, only snapshots of historical events and processes are preserved. When further understanding of ancient Israelite society is sought via archaeology, there are an equal number of constraining issues, including the accurate dating of archaeological materials and the interpretation of archaeological remains, including the social reconstructions that result. Despite such textual and archaeological challenges, however, advancements in understanding ancient Israelite society and the early Israelite monarchy are being made. When both text and archaeology are interpreted together and viewed within a sociologically informed hermeneutic, a more lucid and profound understanding of the early Israelite monarchy is possible. This presentation will discuss some of the various issues and approaches to understanding the early Israelite monarchy of the biblical texts and the social reality behind those texts.</p>

<h2 id="re-dating-the-athenian-empire">Re-dating the Athenian Empire</h2>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>The last decade has seen a sea-change in the dating of Athenian inscriptions from the 5th century B.C. This is largely based on recent scholarly acceptance that the ‘3-bar sigma’ letter-form should not be used as the determining chronological marker. The significance of some important epigraphic evidence must now be reinterpreted in changed contexts. This talk discusses the key evidence and the historiography of the debate. It considers whether the creation of the Athenian archē (empire) was intentional, and the extent to which imperialism should be linked with Perikles.</p>

<h2 id="the-book-of-proverbs-wisdom-women-worldliness">The Book of Proverbs: Wisdom, Women, Worldliness</h2>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>The Book of Proverbs in the Hebrew Bible has been described by Alter as the ‘anthology of anthologies.’ This anthological quality of the book creates a contradictory and complex text, yet one that holds significance for understanding the moral and ethical universe underpinning the religion of Judaism. In this talk, we explore the Book of Proverbs, and consider it in the context of the broader genre of wisdom literature in the Ancient Near East.</p>

<p><strong>Content</strong></p>

<p>This talk is addressed at the BOS content of Sacred Texts (the Hebrew Bible) and Core ethical Teachings (The Book of Proverbs – wisdom, righteousness, purity and generosity of spirit).</p>

<h2 id="the-late-roman-republic-in-2017-recent-developments">The Late Roman Republic in 2017: Recent Developments</h2>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>In this session we shall survey recent developments in the study of the Roman Republic. In particular, we shall explore (briefly) the recent wave of demographic studies seeking to quantify the strength of the Roman State in terms of its ‘human capital’; the current interest in the Roman Republic’s political culture, the role of ‘public opinion’ and notions of the ‘rule of law’ (a report on four international symposia held in 2016 and 2017); the evolving nature of military commands; and the increasingly appreciated role of religio in public affairs and the concept of the predestined Leader (of obvious consequence to the decline of the Republic).</p>

<p>We hope to leave time for a Q&amp;A to follow.</p>

<h2 id="persian-polymath-ibn-sna-and-the-development-of-islamic-philosophy-and-science">Persian Polymath: Ibn Sīna and the Development of Islamic Philosophy and Science</h2>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>Ibn Sīna (c. 980 – 1037 CE), known as Avicenna in the Latin West, is one of the most distinguished intellectuals in the history of Islamic philosophy and science. Although a prolific writer in the Arabic language, Ibn Sīna hailed from modern day Uzbekistan and his native language was Persian. Educated at Bukhara, then one of the premier intellectual capitals of the Islamic world, Ibn Sīna was greatly influenced by the corpus of books found in the libraries of the Samanid princes which contained original works in Persian.</p>

<p>While the influence of Greek scholarship on Islamic philosophy and science has been well-documented, research on the connection with original Persian work has received far less attention. Through the example of Ibn Sīna, this talk will explore the importance of Persian culture and scholarship on the wider field of Islamic philosophy and science in the period that has come to be known as Islam’s ‘Golden Age’.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Ronika Power</strong></p>

<p>Dr Ronika Power is a Lecturer in Bioarchaeology at Macquarie University, an Honorary Fellow of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge, a member of the Big History Institute and the Editor of the British Association for Biological Anthropology and Osteoarchaeology Annual Review. Her research methodology is Biocultural Archaeology, whereby data derived from scientific analyses of the human body is interpreted in conjunction with all other forms of archaeological and historical evidence to provide meaningful insights into the structure, health, life-ways and world-views of individuals and groups from past populations. Dr Power has worked with geographically and temporally diverse populations: from early Holocene hunter-gatherers of Kenya; to megalithic temple builders of Neolithic Malta; multi-period cemeteries across Egypt; the Garamantes of the Pre-Islamic Libyan Sahara; Amarna Period Egyptian colonies in Nubia; Late Anglo-Saxon English child, infant and foetal burials; settlement interments in Medieval Benin; and post-14th century palace burials from the Maldives, to name a few.</p>

<h2 id="how-archaeology-informs-history">How Archaeology Informs History</h2>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>Too often Classical Archaeology has sought to corroborate or ‘prove’ textual accounts using archaeology. The articulation of historical and archaeological evidence is, however, more complex, difficult, and potentially rewarding. Although textual and material evidence rarely speak to one another directly, each can contribute unique insights to an understanding of the past. Issues that are difficult to explore through one approach are often more amenable to the other. This talk will briefly review the history of archaeology, discuss how archaeological and historical approaches can be combined responsibly, and provide a case study from my own research.</p>
